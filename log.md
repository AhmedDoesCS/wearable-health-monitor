# Wearable Health Monitor — Engineering Log

## 2026-01-12
Goal:
- Learn I2C protocols using Arduino basics.
- Extract relevant data from datasheets.

What I did:
- Initialized platformio project.
- Successfully ran I2C communication between LCD and Arduino Mega.

What failed:
- Did not go through datasheets.

What I learned:
- I2C communication through Arduino interfaces uses the Wire.h library as a prerequisite library for other derivative libraries like LiquidCrystal_I2C.h.
- I was able to program LCD control through the Arduino IDE's console using the aforementioned libraries.

Next step:
- Go through datasheets and extract relevant data.
